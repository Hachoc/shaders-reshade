# shaders-reshade
several shaders for reshade 4

MMBR is short of MouseMotionBlur, a shader which can blurs moving things.
totally based on mouse moving, it didn't effects on moving that caused by runing(WASD).

the code is tested on Assassin's Creed  Odyssey.
If it didn't work, try to remove (1- color.alpha).
